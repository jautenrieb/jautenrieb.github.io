Iâ€™m **Johannes**, an aerospace enthusiast deeply passionate about control theory. I am a Research Scientist and PhD Candidate at the [Institute of Flight Systems](https://www.dlr.de/en/ft) at the **German Aerospace Center (DLR)**, advised by Prof. Stefan Levedag. My research focuses on advancing aerospace technologies with a particular emphasis on the safe control of nonlinear systems in uncertain environments. My goal is to identify problems in control theory based on real-world challenges, explore theoretical solutions thoroughly, and apply these insights to practical issues, particularly in the flight control of novel aircraft such as hypersonic glide vehicles and eVTOL air taxis.

As part of my PhD, I had the privilege of visiting the [AAC-Lab](http://aaclab.mit.edu/index.php) at the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), US**, in 2022-23, where I was supervised by Dr. Annuradha Annaswamy. My research there involved developing control barrier functions for safety-critical and adaptive flight control systems. Currently, I am under the supervision of Dr. Jack Umenberger in the [Control Group](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/control/) at the **University of Oxford, UK**, where I am working on robust online optimization algorithms for dynamical systems in uncertain environments.

Before joining DLR, I obtained an **M.Sc. degree in Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control** from Cranfield University, UK, where I worked on adaptive flight control for eVTOL air-taxis both in the UK with Rolls-Royce and at the **Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)**, South Korea. Prior to that, I earned a **B.Eng. degree in Aerospace Engineering** from the University of Applied Sciences Aachen, Germany.

Outside of my research, I am passionate about Olympic boxing, a sport in which I have actively competed and continue to contribute as a coach and trainer. This discipline not only keeps me physically active but also enhances my ability to stay focused and perform under pressure.<br><br>
