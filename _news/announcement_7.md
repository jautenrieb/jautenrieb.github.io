I presented my paper [__Data Fusion-Based Incremental Nonlinear Model Following Control Design for a Hypersonic Waverider Configuration__] at the AIAA SCITECH 2023 Forum in National Harbor. This research focuses on integrating data fusion techniques for improved control system performance of INDI-based control systems in hypersonic vehicles.
