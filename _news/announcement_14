I'm happy to support the robotics community as part of the programme committee for the [__13th International Conference on Robot Intelligence Technology and Applications (RiTA 2025)__](https://icrita.org), taking place December 17–19 at King’s College London. Have a look at the call for papers — it’s a great conference. I'm looking forward to catching up with friends and colleagues in London!
