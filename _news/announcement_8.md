Excited to share that our paper [__Safe and Stable Adaptive Control for a Class of Dynamic Systems__] got accepted and will be presented at the 2023 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC). This research explores new adaptive control methods to ensure stability in dynamic systems, focusing on safety during flight operations.
